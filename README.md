Overview of my Project
======================

This Grading System is a Ruby on rails system that it’s main goal is to allow Professor/Teachers to manage class grades and access the list of students in a school. The student can easily view their grades online through their Student registratration number. With this, they will be able to identify if  they excelled or failed at the end of year. Students will no longer visit the registrar’s office to submit and request for grades because this system will provide the grades and records accurately.
NB: grade marks will be calculated on front end
